# Web_Mapping_with_Python_GeoJSON_and_Leaflet

Manipulate tabular data programmatically to extract geonames and create location-based data. Convert tabular data into a meaningful geographic data structure. 

To begin working on a Covid mapping research project with Dr. Sudipto Ghosh at Colorado State University I was assigned to complete these tutorial projects:

    - https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/mapping-with-python-leaflet
    - https://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start/
    - https://leafletjs.com/examples/mobile/
    
The code in this repository is the completion of the above stated tutorials and will be used as the structure for our research project.
